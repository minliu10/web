    <p><span style="font-size: 60px;">US President</span> Donald Trump has signed an executive order to ban transactions with TikTok's parent company
        ByteDance.</p>
        
          


    <p>The executive order says the US "must take aggressive action against the owners of TikTok to protect our
        national security".</p>
    <p>Under the order, beginning in 45 days, any US transaction with ByteDance will be prohibited.</p>
    <p>TikTok denies accusations it is controlled by or shares data with the Chinese government.</p>
    <p>On Thursday night, the US president also issued a follow-up executive order taking similar action to ban WeChat,
        an app owned by China-based tech giant Tencent.</p>
